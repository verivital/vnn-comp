# MIPVerify
This folder contains code to reproduce the results for the [MIPVerify](https://github.com/vtjeng/MIPVerify.jl) tool on the [benchmark for piecewise linear activations](https://github.com/verivital/vnn-comp/issues/2).

## Manual Installation
  1. Install Julia, Gurobi, a Gurobi License, and relevant packages. [Installation instructions](https://vtjeng.github.io/MIPVerify.jl/v0.2.2/#Installation-1).

## Reproducing Results
### System Specifications
**CPU**: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300U CPU @ 1.90GHz (via `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"`)
**RAM**: 8 GB, DDR3, 1600 MHz (via `sudo dmidecode --type memory | less`)

### Software Versions
**Julia**: 1.4.2 (via `julia --version`)
**Python**: 3.6.9 (via `python3 --version`)
**Gurobi**: 9.0.2 (via `echo $GUROBI_HOME`)

Julia and Python packages dependencies are fully specified in `Manifest.toml` and `REQUIREMENTS.txt` respectively.

> :warning: To ensure that you are running Python scripts with the correct dependencies, please execute the scripts with a virtualenv activated, installing the required packages with the virtualenv activated via `pip3 install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`
> :warning: All `julia` commands should be executed from the `MIPVerify` directory that this README is contained in with the `--project` flag, which ensures that the dependencies specified in `Manifest.toml` are used. If it is necessary to execute the script from a different directory, please use `julia --project=path/to/this/MIPVerify/directory`

### Detailed Instructions
The results for these benchmarks are stored in the [results](./results) directory, organized by benchmark. Each verification script in [scripts/verification](./scripts/verification) saves its results to a `summary.csv` file, which the post-processing scripts in [scripts/reports](./scripts/reports) can convert into a `.txt` file compatible with the report format.

To reproduce the results, remove the folder corresponding to the benchmark that you're trying to reproduce, and follow the following commands.

#### ACASXU-ALL
```
# running verification. output produced at `results/acasxu-all/summary.csv`
julia --project scripts/verification/acasxu-all.jl

# generating `.txt` file compatible with submission format. output produced at `results/acasxu-all.txt`
./scripts/reports/generate_text_submission.py --benchmark_name ACASXU-ALL
```

#### ACASXU-HARD
```
# running verification. output produced at `results/acasxu-hard/summary.csv`
julia --project scripts/verification/acasxu-hard.jl

# generating `.txt` file compatible with submission format. output produced at `results/acasxu-hard.txt`
./scripts/reports/generate_text_submission.py --benchmark_name ACASXU-HARD
```

#### MNIST-OVAL
```
# running verification for each network. output produced in `mnist-oval` directory.
julia --project ./scripts/verification/mnist-net_256x2.jl
julia --project ./scripts/verification/mnist-net_256x4.jl
julia --project ./scripts/verification/mnist-net_256x6.jl

# generating `.txt` file compatible with submission format. output produced at `results/mnist-oval.txt`
./scripts/reports/generate_text_submission.py --benchmark_name MNIST-OVAL

# the `.mat` files used as input in the `networks` directory are produced by running the script
# `./scripts/conversion/extract_onnx_params.py`
```
